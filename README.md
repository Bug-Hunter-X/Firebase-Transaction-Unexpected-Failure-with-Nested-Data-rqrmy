# Firebase Transaction Unexpected Failure with Nested Data
This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Firebase transactions to update nested fields within a document. The issue involves an unexpected transaction failure due to an unhandled exception, resulting in a vague error message that does not clearly indicate the root cause.

## Problem Description
The original code attempts to increment a nested counter within a user document using a transaction. However, the transaction fails without a clear indication of the problem, making debugging difficult. The solution addresses this by handling potential errors during data access and ensuring proper update paths for the nested fields.

## Solution
The solution improves the transaction logic to address the unhandled exception and ensure the transaction completes successfully. It carefully handles the case where the nested field might not yet exist, providing proper initialization and update mechanisms.
